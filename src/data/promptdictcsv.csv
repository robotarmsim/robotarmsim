Go around a big ball in the middle
Look around. notice the box
Lift up to clear an obstacle
Check the edges. stay aware
Look around before moving into the space
Be a bit more cautious of the surroundings
Look over like 'what's going on there?'
Pretend there's a barrier and climb over it
Imagine a wall and go around it
Check left and right blind spots
Keep the 'face' forward. like marching band posture
Follow a set rule: rise. twist. then go straight
Move each joint separately. like they're on rails
Take your time. no rush
Wiggle like a snake
Wander without really knowing where it's going
Move without caring about direction
Twisty but light. snake-like and controlled
Push with steady force. like a horse kick
Heavy drop. strong impact
Quick jab. like a punch
Slam down like a blacksmith hammer
Light tap. just a finger bump
Slow creep forward. creature-like
Soft baby tap
Come down slowly. tap like touching a baby's head
Careful approach. gentle contact
Rushed energy. like people checking phones
Fast little darts. bug-like
Frantic. no real plan
Jerky and anxious. rushed
Urgent but with a strong finish
Power-walk feel: rushed but still deliberate. ending hard
Move like a person rushing around
On time. with pauses along the way
Casual. not worried. just going straight there
Normal walk pace
Leisurely. like smelling flowers and looking at clouds
