# Help and Info Page for Zones

## Introduction / Important Note
Zones do not have any effect on the motion output. They are graphical-only and intended as "nudging" tools to impact how users design movements.

### Usage Instructions
You can add 'Avoid' or 'Required' zones to the canvas area via the buttons in the Operator Menu. You can also clear all zones here. To delete a specific zone, left click and select "delete."

You can choose the zone's location and radius by clicking and dragging it on the canvas.

#### Avoid Zones
Avoid zones are red and will cause the robot arm to flash red when it is moving through one.

#### Required Zones
Required zones are green and will show an X if the arm does not pass through it. The X will switch to a checkmark if the arm successfully passes through it during the motion playtime.

### Saving and Loading

You can download your zone map to reuse at a later point, or save it as a custom configuration.

To use a downloaded zone map, upload it from your files.

Zones will be auto-locked (position and size) when the Operator Menu is closed.
